# NLPFix Analyzers

These are the analyzers that appear on the NLPFix demo page.

## Dates and Times
**REGEX x 1000:** NLP++ is 1000 times more powerful and much more readable and easier to maintain than Regex. You can watch the matching process step by step.

## Formatted Text
**REGEX & PYTHON CANNOT:** Text documents that were converted from formatted text to plain text are impossible to parse using Regex or Python. NLP++ allows for breaking down the formatted text like humans.

## NLP Demo
**THE POWER OF NLP++:** The real power of NLP++ is the ability to consolidate information about entities mentioned throughout a text. This is possible through the use of NLP++ rules, functions, the parse tree, and the knowledge base (conceptual grammar) all working together.
